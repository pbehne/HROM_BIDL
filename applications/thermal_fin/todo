Implement model contrained adaptive sampling
    - Reimplement in PETScVector format
    - PETSc Optimization tools
    - Save intermediate computations of state -> perform POD to improve basis

Improve performance
    - Use PETScMatrix only!

Learning ROM error
    - Architecture for regresion
    - Precompute dataset and use shuffle -COMPLETE-
    - CNNs on finite element nodes

Universal Approximator Theorem
    - Verify 5-parameter UAT (R^5 -> R continuous operator on a compact set. So increasing width should help)
