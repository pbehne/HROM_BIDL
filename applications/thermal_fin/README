This directory contains routines to solve the heat conduction problem in a thermal fin.
The forward_solve.py file provides functions to perform high fidelity forward solves and reduced order 
forward solves.
The rom_error_predict.py file trains a neural network to fit the error between the high fidelity model
and the reduced order model given training examples.
